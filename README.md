Loan Approval Bias Detection using Machine Learning
This project aims to classify loan approvals and analyze potential bias in lending decisions based on borrower characteristics such as race, gender, and income level. Using the publicly available Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) dataset, we build machine learning models to predict loan approval outcomes while focusing on fairness and bias detection.
